# AI Usage Summary

This document explains how AI tools (ChatGPT) were used to support the development of the Help Desk Ticket Workflow final project.

---

## 1. Brainstorming and Planning
AI was used to help select the project option (Ticket Workflow System) and outline the required deliverables.  
The AI provided a structured breakdown of:
- Required folders  
- Recommended documentation  
- Helpful examples and templates  

This allowed the project to be organized before building the repository.

---

## 2. Documentation Assistance
AI assisted in generating several project documents, including:
- Ticket template  
- Ticket workflow process  
- Example completed tickets  
- Troubleshooting guides  
- Knowledge base articles  
- User communication examples  

These templates were later reviewed and edited to match the assignment and personal writing style.

## 3. GitHub & VS Code Guidance
AI provided step-by-step instructions for:
- Creating a GitHub repository  
- Cloning the repo into VS Code  
- Understanding commits, branches, and folder structure  
- Fixing errors with remote origins and repository resets  

This improved my ability to use Git and GitHub confidently.

## 4. Prompts Used
Examples of prompts provided to AI during the project:
- “Help me design a help desk ticket workflow system for my final project.”  
- “Create an example troubleshooting guide for slow PC performance.”  
- “Walk me through how to commit and push changes from VS Code.”  
- “Write a professional email response to a user regarding a network issue.”

## 5. Reflections
AI significantly improved the workflow by:
- Saving time on documentation formatting  
- Providing examples and industry-standard templates  
- Helping troubleshoot Git errors quickly  
- Allowing me to focus on learning help desk concepts rather than copy formatting  

Overall, AI enhanced the clarity, accuracy, and organization of the final project while still allowing me to understand and control the content.
