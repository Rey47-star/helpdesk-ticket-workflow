# Help Desk Ticket Workflow

This document explains the step-by-step workflow for handling IT support tickets in a small help desk environment.

---

## 1. Ticket Creation
A ticket is created when:
- A user submits a request by email, phone, or walk-in  
- A technician creates a ticket on behalf of a user  
- An automated system alerts IT of an incident  

The technician records:
- Issue summary  
- User contact information  
- Device details  
- Priority and category  

---

## 2. Ticket Categorization & Prioritization
The technician assigns:
- **Category:** (Networking, Hardware, Software, Printing, Account Issues, etc.)
- **Priority:**  
  - Low – Minor inconvenience  
  - Medium – User work is slowed  
  - High – User or team is blocked  
  - Critical – System-wide outage  

---

## 3. Technician Assignment
Tickets are assigned based on:
- Skill set  
- Workload  
- Urgency  

The technician acknowledges the ticket and contacts the user if needed.

---

## 4. Troubleshooting & Resolution
The technician performs:
1. Initial diagnosis  
2. Recreates the issue if possible  
3. Attempts step-by-step troubleshooting  
4. Documents every action taken  

If needed:
- The issue may be escalated to a senior technician  
- The issue may require vendor or software support  

---

## 5. User Communication
The technician updates the user when:
- More information is needed  
- A workaround is available  
- The issue is resolved  
- The ticket is closed  

Professional, clear communication is required at all times.

---

## 6. Ticket Closure
A ticket is closed only after:
- The user confirms functionality  
- The technician completes documentation  
- Root cause is identified (if possible)  

The ticket is marked as:
- **Resolved**  
- **Closed**  
- **Awaiting user confirmation** (if needed)

---

## 7. Post-Resolution Follow-Up (Optional)
For repeated or severe issues:
- A follow-up may be scheduled  
- Preventive steps may be documented  
- A KB (Knowledge Base) article may be created
