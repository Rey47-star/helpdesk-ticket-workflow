**Subject:** Update on Your Support Ticket – Wi-Fi Connectivity Issue

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for contacting the IT Help Desk. I’ve reviewed your ticket regarding the Wi-Fi connection issues you’re experiencing.

Here’s what I’ve completed so far:
- Verified the network is functioning normally  
- Checked authentication logs for your account  
- Confirmed that your laptop is detecting the correct network  

Based on my findings, it appears the issue is related to your stored Wi-Fi credentials. I’ve reset your authentication profile server-side, and you should now be able to reconnect.

**Next Step:**  
Please restart your laptop and reconnect to the **Office-WiFi** network. If you are still unable to connect, let me know and I can assist you further.

Thank you,  
**Rey B.**  
IT Help Desk Technician
