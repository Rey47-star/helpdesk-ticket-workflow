# Troubleshooting Guide: Slow PC Performance

This guide outlines steps to diagnose and resolve common causes of slow computer performance.

---

## Step 1: Identify Symptoms
- Is the entire system slow or just specific applications?  
- Does slowness occur at startup, during certain tasks, or randomly?  
- Check Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) for high CPU, memory, or disk usage.

---

## Step 2: Basic Maintenance
- Restart the computer.  
- Run a disk cleanup to remove temporary files.  
- Ensure the operating system and critical drivers are up to date.

---

## Step 3: Check for Resource-Heavy Applications
- Identify any applications using excessive resources.  
- Close unnecessary background programs.  
- Consider disabling startup programs that are not needed.

---

## Step 4: Scan for Malware
- Run a full system anti-virus and anti-malware scan.  
- Remove any detected threats.

---

## Step 5: Hardware Considerations
- Check if the device has sufficient RAM for current workloads.  
- Consider if the hard drive or SSD is near capacity or showing signs of failure.

---

## Step 6: Advanced Diagnostics
- Use built-in diagnostic tools (e.g., Windows Performance Monitor).  
- Consider a professional hardware check if issues persist.
